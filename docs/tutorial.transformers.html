<p>In this tutorial, we will see how we can use the fastai library to fine-tune a pretrained transformer model from the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">transformers library</a> by HuggingFace. We will use the mid-level API to gather the data. Even if this tutorial is self contained, it might help to check the <a href="http://dev.fast.ai/tutorial.imagenette">imagenette tutorial</a> to have a second look on the mid-level API (with a gentle introduction using the higher level APIs) in computer vision.</p>

<p>Then let's import what will need: we will fine-tune the GPT2 pretrained model and fine-tune on wikitext-2 here. For this, we need the <code>GPT2LMHeadModel</code> (since we want a language model) and the <code>GPT2Tokenizer</code> to prepare the data.</p>

Here we will use the basic version (that laready takes a lot of space in memory!) You can change the model used by changing the content of <code>pretrained_weights</code> (if it's not a GPT2 model, you'll need to change the classes used for the model and the tokenizer of course).</p>

 = 2013 – 14 York City F.C. season = 
 
 The 2013 – 14 season was the &lt;unk&gt; season of competitive association football and 77th season in the Football League played by York City Football Club, a professional football club based in York, North Yorkshire, England. Their 17th @-@ place finish in 2012 – 13 meant it was their second consecutive season in League Two. The season ran from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014. 
 Nigel Worthington, starting his first full season as York manager, made eight permanent summer signings. By the turn of the year York were only above the relegation zone on goal difference, before a 17 @-@ match unbeaten run saw the team finish in seventh @-@ place in the 24 @-@ team 2013 – 14 Football League Two. This meant York qualified for the play @-@ offs, and they were eliminated in the semi @-@ final by Fleetwood Town. York were knocked out of the 2013 – 14 FA Cup, Football League Cup and Football League Trophy in their opening round matches. 
 35 players made at least one appearance in nationally organised first @-@ team competition, and there were 12 different &lt;unk&gt;. Defender Ben Davies missed only five of the fifty @-@ two competitive matches played over the season. Wes Fletcher finished as leading scorer with 13 goals, of which 10 came in league competition and three came in the FA Cup. The winner of the &lt;unk&gt; of the Year award, voted for by the club&#39;s supporters, was &lt;unk&gt; Oyebanjo. 
 
 = = Background and pre @-@ season = = 
 
 The 2012 – 13 season was York City&#39;s first season back in the Football League, having won the Conference Premier play @-@ offs in 2011 – 12 after &lt;unk&gt; years in the Football Conference. Manager Gary Mills was sacked in March 2013 following an 11 @-@ match run without a victory, and was replaced by former Northern Ireland manager Nigel Worthington. Despite being in the relegation zone with three matches remaining, Worthington led the team to safety from relegation after a 1 – 0 win away to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge on the final day of the season. York finished the season in 17th @-@ place in the 2012 – 13 League Two table. 
 Following the previous season&#39;s conclusion Lee &lt;unk&gt;, Jon &lt;unk&gt;, Chris &lt;unk&gt;, Ben Everson, Scott Kerr, David &lt;unk&gt;, Patrick &lt;unk&gt;, Michael Potts, Jamie Reed and Jason Walker were released by York, while &lt;unk&gt; Blair departed for Fleetwood Town. David McGurk, &lt;unk&gt; Oyebanjo, Danny Parslow, Tom Platt and Chris Smith signed new contracts with the club. New players signed ahead of the start of the season were goalkeeper Chris &lt;unk&gt; on a season @-@ long loan from Blackpool, defender Ben Davies on loan from Preston North End, midfielders Craig Clay from Chesterfield and Lewis Montrose from Gillingham, winger &lt;unk&gt; Puri from St &lt;unk&gt; and strikers Ryan Bowman from Hereford United, Richard Cresswell from Sheffield United, Wes Fletcher from Burnley and Ryan Jarvis from Torquay United.

 York retained the previous season&#39;s home and away kits. The home kit comprised red shirts with white sleeves, light blue shorts and white socks. The away kit included light blue shirts with white sleeves, white shorts and light blue socks. &lt;unk&gt; Health continued as shirt sponsors for the second successive season.

 York began the season with a 1 – 0 home win over the previous season&#39;s play @-@ off finalists, Northampton Town, with &lt;unk&gt; Jarvis scoring the winning goal in the 90th @-@ minute. However, defeat came in York&#39;s match against Championship side Burnley in the first round of the League Cup, going down 4 – 0 at home. The team endured their first league defeat of the season in the following game after being beaten 2 – 0 away by Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, the home team scoring in each half. York then held Hartlepool United to a 0 – 0 home draw, before being beaten 3 – 2 away by Bristol Rovers, in which Jarvis scored twice before John @-@ Joe O &#39;Toole scored the winning goal for the home team in the 67th @-@ minute. Two signings were made shortly before the transfer deadline ; defender George Taft was signed on a one @-@ month loan from Leicester City, while Middlesbrough midfielder Ryan Brobbel joined on a one @-@ month loan. &lt;unk&gt; John &lt;unk&gt;, who had been told he had no future with the club, departed after signing for FC Halifax Town. Jarvis gave York the lead away at Exeter City before Alan &lt;unk&gt; scored in each half to see the home team win 2 – 1. 
 
 = = = September = = = 
 
 York suffered their first home league defeat of the season after AFC Wimbledon won 2 – 0, with Michael Smith scoring in each half. Former Ipswich Town midfielder Josh Carson, who had a spell on loan with York the previous season, signed a contract until the end of 2013 – 14 and Sheffield United midfielder Elliott &lt;unk&gt; signed on a one @-@ month loan. Brobbel opened the scoring in the second minute of his home debut against Mansfield Town, although the away team went on to score twice to win 2 – 1. York&#39;s run of four defeats ended following a 1 – 1 draw away to Wycombe Wanderers, in which McGurk gave York the lead before the home team levelled through Dean Morgan. Taft was sent back to Leicester after he fell behind McGurk, Parslow and Smith in the pecking order for a central defensive berth. York achieved their first win since the opening day of the season after beating Portsmouth 4 – 2 at home, with Fletcher ( 2 ), Montrose and Jarvis scoring. 
 
 = = = October = = =

The team then hosted Fleetwood Town, and the visitors won 2 – 0 with goals scored in each half by Gareth Evans and &lt;unk&gt; Matt. Scunthorpe United were beaten 4 – 1 at home to end York&#39;s three @-@ match run without a win, with all the team&#39;s goals coming in the first half from Carson, Fletcher and Brobbel ( 2 ). 
 
 = = = November = = = 
 
 Bowman scored his first goals for York away to Cheltenham Town, as York twice fought back from behind to draw 2 – 2. York drew 3 – 3 away to Bristol Rovers to earn a first round replay in the FA Cup, taking the lead through Jarvis before Eliot Richards equalised for the home team. Carson scored a 30 yard volley to put York back in the lead, and after Bristol Rovers goals from Matt &lt;unk&gt; and Chris &lt;unk&gt;, Fletcher scored an 86th @-@ minute equaliser for York. Bowman scored with a header from an O &#39;Neill cross to open the scoring at home to Plymouth Argyle, which was the first goal the visitors had conceded in 500 minutes of action. However, Plymouth equalised 11 minutes later through &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; and the match finished a 1 – 1 draw. York were knocked out of the FA Cup after losing 3 – 2 at home to Bristol Rovers in a first round replay ; the visitors were 3 – 0 up by 50 @-@ minutes before Fletcher pulled two back for York with a penalty and a long @-@ range strike. 
 Defender Keith Lowe, of Cheltenham, and goalkeeper Nick Pope, of Charlton Athletic, were signed on loan until January 2014. They both played in York&#39;s first league defeat in four weeks, 2 – 1 away, to Southend United. &lt;unk&gt; &lt;unk&gt; gave Southend the lead early into the match and Bowman equalised for York with a low strike during the second half, before Luke Prosser scored the winning goal for the home side in stoppage time. With Pope preferred in goal, &lt;unk&gt; returned to Blackpool on his own accord, although his loan agreement would stay in place until January 2014. York then drew 0 – 0 away to Morecambe. After Pope was recalled from his loan by Charlton, York signed Wolverhampton Wanderers goalkeeper Aaron McCarey on loan until January 2014. McCarey kept a clean sheet in York&#39;s 0 – 0 home draw with Rochdale.

York drew 1 – 1 away to Burton Albion, with an own goal scored by Shane &lt;unk&gt; @-@ &lt;unk&gt; giving York the lead in the 64th @-@ minute before the home team equalised eight minutes later through Billy &lt;unk&gt;. Atkinson was released after failing to force himself into the first team and signed for Scarborough Athletic, with whom he had been on loan. York drew 0 – 0 at home with second @-@ placed Oxford United, in which Carson came closest to scoring with a volley that &lt;unk&gt; across the face of the goal. This was followed by another draw after the match away to Accrington Stanley finished 1 – 1, with the home team &lt;unk&gt; 10 minutes after a Fletcher penalty had given York the lead in the 35th @-@ minute. Striker &lt;unk&gt; McDonald, who had been released by Peterborough United, was signed on a contract until the end of the season. York&#39;s last match of 2013 was a 2 – 1 defeat away at Bury, a result that ended York&#39;s run of consecutive draws at five. The home team were 2 – 0 up by the 19th @-@ minute, before Michael Coulson scored York&#39;s goal in the 73rd @-@ minute. This result meant York would begin 2014 in 22nd @-@ position in the table, only out of the relegation zone on goal difference. 
 
 = = = January = = = 
 
 Jarvis scored the only goal in York&#39;s first win since October 2013, a 1 – 0 home victory over Morecambe on New Year&#39;s Day. McCarey was recalled by Wolverhampton Wanderers due to an injury to one of their &lt;unk&gt;, while O &#39;Neill was recalled by Burnley to take part in their FA Cup match.

Lowe was subsequently signed permanently from Cheltenham on a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year contract for an undisclosed fee. Having been allowed to leave the club on a free transfer, Ashley Chambers signed for Conference Premier club Cambridge United. 
 York achieved three successive wins for the first time in 2013 – 14 after beating Northampton 2 – 0 away, with Bowman and Fletcher scoring in three @-@ second half minutes. Defender John McCombe was signed on a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year contract following his release from Mansfield, before Clay and Jamal &lt;unk&gt; left York by mutual consent.

York fell to a successive defeat for the first time since September 2013 after being beaten 2 – 0 at home by Chesterfield. Shortly after the match, Smith left the club by mutual consent to pursue first @-@ team football. 
 
 = = = February = = = 
 
 Fletcher scored a 90th @-@ minute winner for York away to Fleetwood in a 2 – 1 win, a result that ended Fleetwood&#39;s five @-@ match unbeaten run. York then drew 0 – 0 at home to fellow mid @-@ table team Cheltenham, before beating Plymouth 4 – 0 away with goals from Fletcher, McCombe ( 2 ) and Carson as the team achieved successive away wins for the first time in 2013 – 14. York went without scoring for a fourth consecutive home match after drawing 0 – 0 with Southend.

 = = = March = = = 
 
 York achieved their first home win in five matches after beating Exeter 2 – 1, with first half goals scored by McCombe and Coulson. Hayhurst&#39;s loan was extended to the end of the season, having impressed in his six appearances for the club. Coulson scored again with the only goal, a 41st @-@ minute header, in York&#39;s 1 – 0 away win over AFC Wimbledon. Bowman scored the only goal with a 32nd @-@ minute penalty as York won 1 – 0 away against Mansfield, in which Fletcher missed the opportunity to extend the lead when his stoppage time penalty was saved by Alan Marriott. York moved one place outside the play @-@ offs with a 2 – 0 home win over Wycombe, courtesy of a second Bowman penalty in as many matches and a Carson goal from the edge of the penalty area. Coulson scored York&#39;s only goal in a 1 – 0 away win over struggling Portsmouth with a low volley in the fifth @-@ minute ; this result meant York moved into the play @-@ offs in seventh @-@ place with eight fixtures remaining. 
 Striker Calvin Andrew, who had been released by Mansfield in January 2014, was signed on a contract for the remainder of the season. He made his debut as a substitute in York&#39;s 1 – 0 home win over bottom of the table Torquay, in which Hayhurst scored the only goal in the 11th @-@ minute with an 18 yard shot that &lt;unk&gt; off Aaron &lt;unk&gt;. Middlesbrough winger Brobbel rejoined on loan until the end of the season, following an injury to Carson.

With the team recording six wins and one draw in March 2014, including six clean sheets, Worthington was named League Two Manager of the Month. 
 
 = = = April = = = 
 
 Pope made a number of saves as York held league leaders Rochdale to a 0 – 0 away draw, with a point being enough to lift the team back into seventh @-@ place. York were prevented from equalling a club record of eight consecutive clean sheets when Accrington scored a stoppage time equaliser in a 1 – 1 home draw, in which York had taken earlier taken the lead with a Coulson penalty. A 1 – 0 win away win over Oxford, which was decided by a second half Coulson penalty, resulted in York moving one place above their opponents and back into seventh @-@ place. York consolidated their place in a play @-@ off position after beating Bury 1 – 0 at home with a fifth @-@ minute goal scored by Lowe from a Hayhurst corner. The result meant York opened up a five @-@ point lead over eighth @-@ placed Oxford with two fixtures remaining. A place in the League Two play @-@ offs was secured following a 1 – 0 win over Newport at home, in which Coulson scored the only goal in the 77th @-@ minute with a 25 yard free kick. Pope earned a nomination for League Two Player of the Month for April 2014, having conceded only one goal in five matches in that period. 
 
 = = = May = = = 
 
 The league season concluded with an away match against divisional runners @-@ up Scunthorpe ; having gone two goals down York fought back to draw 2 – 2 with goals scored by Brobbel and Andrew. This result meant York finished the season in seventh @-@ place in League Two, and would thus play fourth @-@ placed Fleetwood in the play @-@ off semi @-@ final on the back of a 17 @-@ match unbeaten run. York lost 1 – 0 to Fleetwood in the first leg at &lt;unk&gt; Crescent ; the goal came from former York player &lt;unk&gt; Blair in the 50th @-@ minute, who scored from close range after Antoni &lt;unk&gt;&#39;s shot was blocked on the line. A 0 – 0 draw away to Fleetwood in the second leg meant York were eliminated 1 – 0 on aggregate, ending the prospect of a second promotion in three seasons. At an awards night held at York Racecourse, Oyebanjo was voted &lt;unk&gt; of the Year for 2013 – 14. 
 
 = = Summary and aftermath = = 
 
 York mostly occupied the bottom half of the table before the turn of the year, and dropped as low as 23rd in September 2013. During February 2014 the team broke into the top half of the table and with one match left were in sixth @-@ place. York&#39;s defensive record was the third best in League Two with 41 goals conceded, bettered only by Southend ( 39 ) and Chesterfield ( 40 ). Davies made the highest number of appearances over the season, appearing in 47 of York&#39;s 52 matches. Fletcher was York&#39;s top scorer in the league and in all competitions, with 10 league goals and 13 in total.

 = Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; ( 2008 ) = 
 
 Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; was the tenth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. &lt;unk&gt; developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August 31. The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located 170 mi ( 270 km ) to the south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde Islands on September 2. The depression was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; around noon the same day. Over the next several days, &lt;unk&gt; moved in a general west @-@ northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on September 3. Strong wind shear, some due to the outflow of Hurricane Ike, and dry air caused the storm to weaken. On September 6, the combination of wind shear, dry air, and cooling waters caused &lt;unk&gt; to weaken into a tropical depression. &lt;unk&gt; deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm. The low ultimately dissipated while located 520 mi ( 835 km ) east of &lt;unk&gt; on September 10. However, the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of St. Croix.

 Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa near the end of August 2008. It tracked south of Cape Verde and slowly developed, and on September 2 the disturbance became Tropical Depression Ten while located south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde islands. As the depression became more organized, an eye @-@ like feature developed in the upper levels of the system. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm &lt;unk&gt; six hours after forming. &lt;unk&gt; was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly. 
 &lt;unk&gt; continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical. However, due to the location of the storm, there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings, and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity. Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm, the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification. The storm was also heading into an area where shear was &lt;unk&gt; to significantly increase due to an upper @-@ level trough diving southward. Despite convection being partially removed from the center of &lt;unk&gt;, the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September 3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized. The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening, causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger. 
 &lt;unk&gt; reached its peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) around 8 a.m. ( &lt;unk&gt; ) as it continued to become more organized. However, there were indications that it had already begun to weaken. &lt;unk&gt; towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm, a sign that dry air was entering the system. During the afternoon hours, the structure of &lt;unk&gt; began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll. By the late night, the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center. 
 Despite continuing effects from the strong wind shear, a large, deep burst of convection formed in the northern &lt;unk&gt; of &lt;unk&gt;. The center was found to have shifted towards the new convection leading to an increase in intensity. The forecast showed a slight decrease in wind shear as &lt;unk&gt; continued westward and no change in intensity over the 5 @-@ day forecast was predicted. However, the convection decreased once more and the low became completely exposed by the late morning hours and &lt;unk&gt; weakened again. By the afternoon, the center of &lt;unk&gt; was only a &lt;unk&gt; of clouds, devoid of convection. During the overnight hours on September 4 into the morning of September 5, convection associated with &lt;unk&gt; began to &lt;unk&gt; somewhat, mostly to the north of the circulation, due to the strong &lt;unk&gt; wind shear. By mid @-@ morning, &lt;unk&gt; re @-@ intensified slightly due to the redevelopment of some convection. However, the redevelopment was short lived and wind shear again took its toll on &lt;unk&gt; by late morning. The convection around the system became &lt;unk&gt; from the center and &lt;unk&gt; weakened slightly. 
 The weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong &lt;unk&gt; shear. &lt;unk&gt; became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid @-@ afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ), barely holding on to tropical storm status. &lt;unk&gt; regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours, but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm. Due to the lack of convection, &lt;unk&gt; was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at &lt;unk&gt; ( &lt;unk&gt; ) with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ). Since there was no convection around the system, it would have normally been classified a remnant low but, due to the possibility of the storm &lt;unk&gt; over the next several days, it was considered a tropical depression. The next morning, &lt;unk&gt; was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm. No redevelopment was expected with &lt;unk&gt; as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated. 
 However, the remnant low associated with &lt;unk&gt; began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7. &lt;unk&gt; around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed. On September 8, wind shear took over the system again. &lt;unk&gt; around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more. The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September 9, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of &lt;unk&gt; deteriorating into an open wave. However, on September 10, the remnants of &lt;unk&gt; redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system. Once more, the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of &lt;unk&gt; headed towards the Bahamas. However, on September 14, dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely. 
 
 = = Impact = = 
 
 As &lt;unk&gt; passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands on September 2, outer rain bands produced minor rainfall, totaling around 0 @.@ 55 inches ( 14 mm ). There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor. 
 Several days after the low dissipated, the remnant moisture from &lt;unk&gt; brought showers and thunderstorms to St. Croix where up to 1 in ( 25 @.@ 4 mm ) of rain fell. The heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding. No known damage was caused by the flood.

<p>The HuggingFace model will return a tuple in outputs, with the actual predictions and some additional activations (should we want to use them is some regularization scheme). To work inside the fastai training loop, we will need to drop those using a <a href="/callback.core#Callback"><code>Callback</code></a>: we use those to alter the behavior of the training loop.</p>
<p>Here we need to write the event <code>after_pred</code> and replace <code>self.learn.pred</code> (which contains the predictions that will be passed to the loss function) by just its first element. In callbacks, there is a shortcut that lets you access any of the underlying <a href="/learner#Learner"><code>Learner</code></a> attribute so we can write <code>self.pred[0]</code> instead of <code>self.learn.pred[0]</code>. That shorcut only works for read access, not write, so we have to write <code>self.learn.pred</code> on the right side (otherwise we would set a <code>pred</code> attribute in the <a href="/callback.core#Callback"><code>Callback</code></a>).</p>
